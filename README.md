# StarCubing

This is an implementation of Dong Xin's paper (http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/vldb03_starcube.pdf). Starcubing is a data cube computation algorithm that aims to prune and aggregate data by combining Bottom Up and Top Down processes to reduce the computational cost seen in Bottom Up Computation (BUC) and multiway aggregation. The algorithm was tested on different datasets on the UCI machine learning database (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) with the adjustment of a few parameters. A detailed report is included in the Documentations folder.
